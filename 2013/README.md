# Computer Club 2013 #

This year, we dive into the world of GNU/Linux and beyond into some of the cool parts of IT that have interested us in computers.

- Week 1: An welcome to the club for the year, and introduction to Linux, free and open source software, and VirtualBox.
- Week 2: TBD (Installing Linux in VirtualBox)
- Week 3: TBD (Making your way around Ubuntu Linux)

## General Stuff you should be aware of ##

- Linux is not Windows
- You should be able to use a computer in a generally competent manner. You should be aware roughly how a computer works (that is, not as "a piece of plastic that displays different stuff when I click on this thing called a mouse" but as "a processor that enables programs to run, interact with the user via the screen, keyboard and mouse, and optionally modify or read from storage (ie the hard disk)"
- Linux is not Windows
- The club is targeted at beginner-intermediate computer users who are interested in what Linux is/has to offer. If you've been a Linux kernel developer for 5 years, are Linus Torvalds in disguise, or have a certified degree in computer badassery from the CIA, this club will not help you.
- Linux is not Windows
- If you are not careful with Linux/play with it without experience outside the scope of the club, you can easily destroy a lot of your own data and/or brick your computer. This is not intended as a restriction, rather as a caution to be careful until you know more
- Linux is not Windows
- The club is not about/focussed on any of the following: hacking, programming, 3D graphics, making games, mixing music, editing videos, etc. Whilst these are all part of computing, they are beyond the scope of the club this year
- Linux is not Windows
