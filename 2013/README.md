# Computer Club 2013 #

This year, we dive into the world of GNU/Linux and beyond into some of the cool parts of IT that have interested us in computers.

- Week 1: An welcome to the club for the year, and introduction to Linux, free and open source software, and VirtualBox.

## General Stuff you should be aware of ##

- Linux is not Windows
- If you are not careful with Linux/play with it without experience outside the scope of the club, you can easily destroy a lot of your own data and/or brick your computer. This is not intended as a restriction, rather as a caution to be careful until you know more
- The club is not about/focussed on any of the following: hacking, programming, 3D graphics, making games, mixing music, editing videos, etc. Whilst these are all part of computing, they are beyond the scope of the club this year
