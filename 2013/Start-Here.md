# Starting With Computer Club 2013 #

This guide aims to show how you should set yourself up for Computer Club 2013

## Requirements ##

1. A USB Stick (preferably > 8 GB)
2. Access to the "Computer Club" Folder on the S-Drive (ask for access at the club)


## Installation ##

1. Insert USB Drive and ensure formatted to NTFS:
  - If a new drive, just right click -> Format -> Type: NTFS (note: will delete all data)
  - If an old drive, follow this: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows-vista/convert-a-hard-disk-or-partition-to-ntfs-format

2. Go to the S-Drive and Locate the "Computer Club" Folder:
  - Copy both of the files in that folder onto your USB drive (whether on the root or in a folder)
  - Note: This could take some time, do only at a time in which computers are not busy

3. You're Done! Go onto "Usage"

## Usage ##

The first time you want to run Linux on a computer, you'll have to run the Virtualbox EXE file and click through to install virtualbox:
  - Run the Virtualbox Installer
  - Create a new VM (with "New")
  - Continue to Hard-Drive Section, and select "Existing Hard Drive" And locate the file on your USB.

From then on, you can just load up the virtualbox program, and fire up the VM.
