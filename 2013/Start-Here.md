# Starting With Computer Club 2013 #

This guide aims to show how you should set yourself up for Computer Club 2013. This guide also assumes that you just want to follow along without being too adventurous.

## Requirements ##

1. A USB Stick (preferably >= 8 GB)
2. Access to the "Computer Club" Folder on the S-Drive (ask for access at the club)

## Setting up your USB ##

1. Insert your USB Drive and ensure it is formatted as NTFS:
  - Right Click the drive in Windows Explorer, click format, select NTFS
  - >>>NOTE: FORMATTING WILL WIPE ALL DATA ON YOUR DRIVE<<<
  - You can then copy back the files you originally had, but please note that this will decrease the amount of space available to your virtual Linux installation

2. Go to the S-Drive and Locate the "Computer Club" Folder:
  - Copy both of the files in that folder onto your USB drive. It doesn't really matter where you put it. If you know what you're doing, get the VirtualBox installer straight from virtualbox.org.
  - Note: This could take some time, do only at a time in which the computers are not busy
  - Note: The permissions and access to the Computer Club folder have not been setup yet. The final disk image has now been built after being tweaked due to issues with VirtualBox. However, further testing needs to be done. The updated copy hasn't been pushed to the S: drive yet either. Updates will be posted to github and to the mailing list when stuff happens.

OPTIONAL:

For those of you who are paranoid and/or have the technical knowhow, the VirtualBox installer and .vdi will be furnished with signed SHA-512 cryptographic hashes for verification and anti-tampering purposes.
The hash and associated signature will be provided in signature.asc. More information will be made available in the near future.

> The following section is optional for Week 1<

## Installing and setting up VirtualBox ##

1. Run the VirtualBox installer that you copied to your USB.
2. Read and follow the VirtualBox Setup Guide provided.

## Then what? ##

- Next week you'll be installing VirtualBox on the school computers. If you don't feel ready to install it on your home computer, you can get support then and install at home after that session.
- If you're feeling daring, run the virtual machine, play with it, etc.
- If you're feeling even more daring/capable, start from a clean disk image and install your own Linux.
