# Starting With Computer Club 2013 #

This guide aims to show how you should set yourself up for Computer Club 2013. This guide also assumes that you just want to follow along without being too adventurous.

## Requirements ##

1. A USB Stick (preferably >= 8 GB)
2. Access to the "Computer Club" Folder on the S-Drive (ask for access at the club)

## Setting up your USB ##

1. Insert your USB Drive and ensure it is formatted as NTFS:
  - Right Click the drive in Windows Explorer, click format, select NTFS
  - >>>NOTE: FORMATTING WILL WIPE ALL DATA ON YOUR DRIVE<<<
  - You can then copy back the files you originally had, but please note that this will decrease the amount of space available to your virtual Linux installation

2. Go to the S-Drive and Locate the "Computer Club" Folder:
  - Copy both of the files in that folder onto your USB drive. It doesn't really matter where you put it
  - Note: This could take some time, do only at a time in which the computers are not busy
  - Note: The permissions and access to the Computer Club folder have not been setup yet. In addition, the final disk image is stil being built due to issues experienced with VirtualBox. Updates will be posted to github and to the mailing list when stuff happens.

> The following section is optional for Week 1<

## Installing and setting up VirtualBox ##

1. Run the VirtualBox installer that you copied to your USB.
2. After you've installed VirtualBox, open it
3. Click on "New" to create a new virtual machine
4. Choose some name for your VM. This doesn't matter that much. Select Linux as your Operating System, and Ubuntu (not Ubuntu 64-bit) as the version.
5. If you're installing at home, give the virtual machine memory that you're comfortable with, based on how much you have. 1GB should be enough.
6. Then choose the existing hard disk file, which is just the mint.vdi file that you copied to your USB
7. Then simply click create, and your virtual machine is created 

## Then what? ##

- Next week you'll be installing VirtualBox on the school computers. If you don't feel ready to install it on your home computer, you can get support then and install at home after that session.
- If you're feeling daring, run the virtual machine, play with it, etc.
- If you're feeling even more daring/capable, start from a clean disk image and install your own Linux.
