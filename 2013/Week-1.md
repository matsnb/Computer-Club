# Week 1 Summary #

The first week is about a general introduction to what Linux is, why we care, free and open source software (FOSS), and the basic foundations of running a GNU/Linux system inside a virtual environment (VirtualBox)

## Miscellaneous Stuff ##

- This club will not automagically turn you all into badass supergeeks. That requires time and effort.
- Whilst Linux encourages customisation and tweaking at quite a low level, hacking is not condoned. Please do not tamper with school systems, port scan stuff, etc etc.

## Operating Systems (OSes) ##

- Operating Systems are those "master programs" that manage a computer's resources and oversees user programs. Examples: Microsoft Windows, Mac OSX
- Linux is an operating system *kernel*
- A kernel is the central part of an OS which juggles resources between user programs, manages hardware, etc.
- Other programs, such as the desktop environment (i.e. stuff you can click on), various utilities, etc. run on top of the kernel and make up the rest of the operating system
- In most desktop Linux systems, a lot of this user stuff is provided by the GNU project, hence many Linux OSes might be called "GNU/Linux"
- However most people simply call the whole OS "Linux"
- Similarly, Android is an operating system that has Google's touch optimised interface, etc. built on top of the Linux kernel
- Linux is NOT a program that you install on Windows or Mac. It is a replacement for these.

## A bit of history ##

- The Linux kernel was first written back in the 1990s by a cool kid from Scandinavia
- This was combined with the GNU project, which had been going since the 1980s, to make a usable GNU/Linux operating system

## How is Linux important today? ##

- Linux is popular in enterprise for its security, reliability, and customisability
- 95% of supercomputers run Linux, again for reliability and customisability
- The majority of web servers run Linux
- Android runs on a Linux kernel

## Why should we use/care about Linux? ##

- Free and open source software (FOSS) - GNU/Linux and many programs written for it are based on the principles of customising, sharing and working together as a community (it's also completely free. 100%. If you pay for Linux, you're either paying for other stuff like support, or you're getting swindled)
- Customisable. The user has the POWAH
- Secure. Much more so than even Mac, and definitely Windows. The Android malware situation is not applicable to GNU/Linux systems.
- Reliable. Linux systems rarely crash, if ever, which is why the majority of web servers use Linux, and can stay continuously online for years
- Fast. Windows is slow and bloated. The fastest Linux desktops can boot from cold start in under 5 seconds, but a standard installation will still shave tens of seconds off startup times. Interfaces are faster and more responsive, because of lighter memory requirements. Linux systems also take up much less disk space.

Still need bit on distros, virtualisation, installation
